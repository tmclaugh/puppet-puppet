# XXX: auth classes cannot be stacked! Stacking modules would make it
# impossible to remove an authorization on the client once it had been
# added since classes have no knowledge of each other.

# XXX: This should live in base and its eventual successor!

# This class does not work on its own and is meant to be inherited
